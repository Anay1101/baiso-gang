            <p class="question">Q1: What does Baiso Gang actually do?</p>
            <p class="answer">We are experts in turning calm into chaos. Our mission is to ensure your life is never boring. If there’s silence, we fill it with laughter, confusion, and occasionally, rumors about aliens in Ruikar Colony.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q2: Why are you called "Baiso Gang"?</p>
            <p class="answer">Because “Baiso” sounds cool and mysterious. Plus, it’s a polite way of saying “sit down” in Marathi, which we never do. We're always on the move, spreading fun and confusion!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q3: How can I join the Baiso Gang?</p>
            <p class="answer">First, you need to fail a common sense test. Then, submit a video of you confusing a tea vendor with fake breaking news. We’ll review it in our weekly “Baiso-mittee” meeting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q4: Do you have a leader in the gang?</p>
            <p class="answer">Of course! Our leader is <em>Nanu the Navigator</em>, the person who once got lost in a straight street but managed to confuse everyone into thinking it was a maze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q5: What’s your favorite prank?</p>
            <p class="answer">We love starting rumors that the Ruikar Colony tea stall is giving free tea to anyone who does the moonwalk. The line gets wild, and the dance moves? Priceless.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q6: Do you ever spread actual news?</p>
            <p class="answer">Absolutely not! Our motto is, “If it’s true, it’s boring.” We specialize in spicy, 100% made-up content. Fake it till you make it... confusing!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q7: What’s the secret to your success?</p>
            <p class="answer">It’s a mix of creative storytelling, bad time management, and Nanu’s unmatched ability to convince people that a mango is actually an orange.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q8: How do people react to your antics?</p>
            <p class="answer">Some laugh, some cry, and some try to chase us. But no worries, we’ve got a 99.9% escape rate. That 0.1%? Well, we don’t talk about that incident with the flowerpot...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q9: Why Ruikar Colony?</p>
            <p class="answer">It’s the perfect playground! The people here are like us—full of life and always up for some drama. Also, we heard the tea here increases creativity. It’s working, right?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="question">Q10: What’s next for the Baiso Gang?</p>
            <p class="answer">World domination... or maybe just a flash mob at the Ruikar Colony park. Depends on what mood Nanu’s in after lunch.</p>
